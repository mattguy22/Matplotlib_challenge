# Matplotlib_challenge

 This project Matplotlib_Challenge involves analyzing and visualizing data from a mouse drug trial study.  The analysis encompases generating key
 insights using Matplotlib, Pandas, and statistical tools.  This project also generates bar and pie charts, quartiles, outliers, boxplots, scatter
 plots, and linear regression to interpret the relationship between tumor volume, specific drug regimen, and mouse weight.  

 References: 
 1.  Summary Statistics: 
 Referenced Module 5 for the <agg> function to calculate summary statistics.
 2.  Bar and Pie Charts: 
 Referenced Module 5 and activities were referenced for bar chart formatting, pie chart plotting, and using <autopct> for percentages.
 ChatGPT helped format x-axis labels and avoid overlaps.
 3.  Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots Section:  
 Combined Module 5.2 activities, and ChatGPT to calculate IQR, ChatGPT to handle syntax errors in <for> loop, and filter data using <isin>.
 4.  Correlation and Regression:
 Used Module 5.3 for the <from scipy.stats importlingress> function and ChatGPT for constructing the regression line and visualizations.
